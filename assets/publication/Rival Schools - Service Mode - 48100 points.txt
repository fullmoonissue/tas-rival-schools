‚ÑπÔ∏è  About the run

* Emulator used : BizHawk 2.8 (https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk)
* Aims for maximum score

üèÅ  TAS of Service Mode

This is the TAS of one of the four mini games, service mode.
You play Natsu and you have to score by smashing faces.

To unlock it, either :
- finish the history mode with Natsu on the hardest difficulty
- assign the value 65535 (0xFFFF) on the DWord 0x1F65D0 (it unlocks all mini-games)

üíØ Maximum score

After making 39700, 42300, 44400, 44700 and 45800 points (cf TAS obsoleted), I've improved for the last time (?) the maximum score with 48100 points.

The only improvement I see is to make a score of 6700 points for the shoots 4 and 6.
Here are two unsuccessful attempts :
- Hinata smashed 1 frame earlier : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZUC2wqREBk
- Shoma almost smashed : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-TWHkK64i0

üíæ  Memory addresses

Body Angle :
- 0x1EF90A (Word, Signed)
- Range : -512 ... +512
- Step increment : +/- 4 units per frame

Shoot Angle :
- 0x1EFA70 (Word, Unsigned)
- Range : 0 ... 127
- Step increment : + 1 unit per frame

Shoot Power :
- 0x1EFA74 (Word, Unsigned)
- Range : 0 ... 2048 (cf Shoot power & Wait cycle for more info)
- Step increment : + 24 units per frame

‚ûñ  Raizo

Even if Raizo substracts 200 points to the score, he's part of some shoots because more points are made thanks to the combo multiplier resulting to the smash of his face.

üîã Shoot power & Wait cycle

There is 3 cycles of values :
- from 0 to 2040 (next value is 16)
- from 16 to 2032 (next value is 8)
- from 8 to 2024 (next value is 0)

Some shoots must have a certain power value, thus a cycle of power has to be ignored (by waiting) to have the wanted value.

üö©  TAS obsoleted

This TAS obsoletes five previous ones.
