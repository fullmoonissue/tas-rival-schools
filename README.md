## Tas of Home Run Mode

All shoots was done without moving. The distances are the farther I could have.

One possible optimisation is to try to move before shooting.

An other one is to shoot for nothing before (give some run-up maybe).

I saw a 141 meters done [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnikyC--gL4&t=5m), worth an other try to optimize.

Even if Raizo decrements points, it will start a combo which will give more points than not touching him.

When a combo is done, I smash Shoma in last because he give more points.

Score : 42300

## Tas of Target Mode

Curving ball and frame knocking give more points.

Touching two frames in the same shoot is it possible ?
